#Single Column Website HW
#Requirement
Your page should have at least 6 semantic div sections, including a <header> and a <footer>.
The header must contain links to those sections.

Note: You'll need to figure out how to link to id names for this functionality to work.

At least one of your sections needs to use a background image.
One of your sections needs to have at least four pictures.
Use a hexidecimal color code at least once.

#Bonus
Import and apply a font-family from Google Fonts
Use positioning to make your header a "fixed header"
Use the :hover psuedoclass to add visual styles when a user hovers over something
